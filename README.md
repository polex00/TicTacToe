# TicTacToe
TicTacToe player vs computer Python game.
At the beginning you can choose which sign you want to be, X or O and which difficulty level you want.
I hope you will like it! :D

P.S. For playing without problems, you need both main.py file and images folder, located in same directory. Also, you need to install pygame Python extension. If you have installed Python on your device(then probably you have pip also installed), you just need to go to CMD and type 'pip istall pygame'. After installing you will be able to run it.
